# The Period Alphabet
A project by Danika Jaskulak-Gonzalez built using React, Redux, and React Router

## The Idea
The idea behind The Period Alphabet is to be a supplemental source of information regarding sexual and reproductive health for people with uteruses and/or who identify as a woman. 

Considering sex-ed and health information provided to youth in the United States varies from state to state and these topics are highly stigmatized, this site aims to de-stigmatize these subjects and provide community to those who need it.
